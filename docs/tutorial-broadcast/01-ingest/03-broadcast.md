# What is Registrix Broadcaster

The Registrix broadcaster is a browser based broadcasting tool that will send a stream using WebRTC into its streaming server. You can use a virtual output, Newtek NDI protocols in order to provide a video feed. You can also use a standard webcam and perform a screen share. 

## Getting Started

You must get the link for the service from the Editor or Admin of the channel that you will broadcast onto. If your email contained a seperate message relating to the streamKey, click on the gear button on the bottom of the screen and paste the stream key into the box and click on the Save button.

## About the user interface

At the top of the screen will show you if your stream is offline or online and what resolution that is configured.

The center portion of the screen contains the video feed that will be broadcasted.

The bottom contains all the icons that will allow you to mute your microphone, turn on or off the webcam, enable the screen share, the settings and finally the Start Streaming button.

### Settings

In order to select the virtual output, webcam and microphone click on the settings gear.

To the top of the window that appears is a drop down that allows you to select the Webcam or your virtual output device.

The next option is about the microphone. If you are using a virtual output device it would be in the best case to use an virtual audio output from the switching software. If your system doesn't provide an audio output check into using an Audio Cable like https://vb-audio.com/Cable/

The channel type should be at Standard unless you want to send out a lower quality feed. 

Select your maximum stream resolution, general use 720p for best performance. The higher the resolution means your internet upload bandwith needs to be at least 7.4Mbps


### Newtek NDI

The Registrix Broadcaster does support Newtek NDI version 5.  For more information please refer to https://ndi.video/
