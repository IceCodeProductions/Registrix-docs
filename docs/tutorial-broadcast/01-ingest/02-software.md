# Local Install Switcher Software

You can use a local based switching software such as VMIX, Wirecast, MimoLive, Streamlabs or OBS studio and others that will allow you to use their virtual output and use the browser broadcast ingest tool or you can stream out using RTMP.

In order to achieve low latency you must setup the following **[RTMP Settings](/faqs/encoder/setting-rtmp-ivs/)**.

If your stream is requiring an SRT service please contact your account manager.
