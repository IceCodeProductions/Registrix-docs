# Online Switcher Services

Using online switching software services such as StreamYard, Restream, StageTen, SocialStream and others can be used with Registrix Streaming services by using their custom RTMP feeds.

In order to achieve low latency you must setup the following **[RTMP Settings](/faqs/encoder/setting-rtmp-ivs/)** if they allow this.
