# Browser Based WebRTC Broadcasting

You can use a browser to use as an ingestion source. Using a dual monitor you can perform a screen share (powerpoint) and your webcam in the same video stream. Using Registrix Broadcast service this allows you to stream your Primary Registrix channel without any additional hardware or software.

Our Primary Streaming service will allow you to broadcast your message to 1,000s of viewers.

## Considerations

Should be running a Chrome based browser for best results which include Chrome and Edge. Avoid security based browsers such as opera, firefox, brave, safari as they may block many features such as screen share or they are not fully complaint.
