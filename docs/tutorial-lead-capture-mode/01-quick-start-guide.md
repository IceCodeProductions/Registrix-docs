# Quick Start Guide

These directions will be the minimum that you need to setup to get your event live.

## New Installation

Following the steps below or in the Guides folder to get your Registrix instance up and running.

1.) Configure the **[Attendee](guides/attendee-option)** options.

2.) Setup the **[Lead Generation](attendee-capture)** Data fields that you want to collect.

3.) Upload any custom fonts you want to use **[Fonts](guides/brand-font)**.

4.) Build your Attendee Login template **[Templates for Login](/tutorial-templates/login/overview)** .

5.) Build a Video Page template **[Templates for Watch](/tutorial-templates/watch/overview)**.

6.) Start **[Managing Events](/tutorial-events/overview)**.


## Attendee Experiences

- Open Enrollment
  - This allows an attendee to enter their email address and additional data points that the administrator of the event wants to collect. The attendee has to only go
  thru the data collection just one time. The next time they return, they just have to enter their email address.
- Approved Participant
  - The attendee must have a record as a Participant in order to watch the event. The administrator can upload a CSV list, perform data entry and add a record, or data can be synced by a CRM application. This selection does not allow anyone to join the event.
- Skip Data Collection on Existing Participant
  - Anyone can enter an email address into the attendee app. If the attendee's email is found in the Participant records, no additional data will be collected for this attendee.


## Maintenance

Most maintenance is performed in the **[Managing Events](/tutorial-events/overview)**.

If you discover domains that should be blocked you can make changes to the **[Block Domains](block-domain)**.

The other area of maintenance is **[Participants](/docs/tutorial-participant/overview)**.  This is where you can create/edit/disable information about the participants.
