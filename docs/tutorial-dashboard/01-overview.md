# Overview of Dashboard and Moderating

The services in the dashboard are designed to allow you to control the live event during the performance. Everyone that has a role of Moderator, Editor and Admin has access to this area. 

You are able to assign different people to different Moderator Service Roles.  A person assigned to perform only Moderator activities should be set as a role of Moderator. This account cannot make any changes to the Event or System. They can only perform Moderation services.

To get started click on the Dashboard to the left side menu, then select the type of service that they need to moderate.

The Control Panel is the only service that is designed to have only 1 person access the service per event. If you are the only moderator for all the different services then you can control all the services with the Control Panel.

Any of the Moderate services are designed for teams and can have as many Moderators are the project requires. So if one moderator performs an action, every other moderator on that screen will see the event that occured.
