From the left side menu, click on **Dashboard**, then click **Live Events Control Panel**.  Now select the event to moderate. A lower panel of options now appear for this event.

## Operations

The buttons on the top window allow you to work with all the attendees that are logged into this instance of Registrix.  The buttons **BROADCAST ALL** and **SEND TO EVENT ALL** will impact every attendee in any event.

### Broadcast All

In order to send a message to all attendees that are currently log into this instance click the **BROADCAST ALL** button at the top of the page.  A window will appear allowing you to enter a message (Do not use any HTML syntax).  You can send with the message a button for the attendees to click if you want to complete a survey at the end of the event.  Enter the button text like "Take Survey Now" and then enter the complete URL including the https://  We strongly recommend that you have tested the URL in advance and copy and paste this into this column.

Select in the drop down the event that you want them to be sent to.  Then click the **SEND** button.  Over the next 6 seconds all attendees will be at this event.

## Event Specific Controls

After selecting an event in the upper control panel, a lower window will appear that you can scroll down to that now relates only to the event you selected. The blue bar is an indicator to you about when the data will be updating, normally around 12 seconds.  You can pause the updating of the control panel screens by unchecking the Auto Update check box.

All the buttons and tabs are relating to this event that has been setup in the Events / Manage section.

### Default/Change Interactive Tab

On the attendees screen you can control what tab that the attendee is on right now by selecting the dropdown and changing the tab.  All attendees in this event will change as soon as the new dropdown item has been selected.

### Change Souce from:

The change source button may appear if you have setup the Cue Card, Post Card or any backup streaming solution.  Many use cases at the end of the show a post card is created as a thank you for attending.  At the end of the livestream you can change the souce to Post Card by clicking on the **CHANGE SOURCE FROM:** button and select any of the available options. After clicking the **Proceed** button the attendee will then see the select item.

### Force attendees to refresh

In some rare situtions you need to force the attendees to refresh their browser window. This can be because the logo, text description, or live stream service needs to be reloaded.  Instead of going into a chat and tell the viewers to refresh their browser, you can force their browsers to refresh.  Simply click on the **FORCE REFRESH** button and all the attendees browsers will reload automatically and return back to this event.

Depending on the live stream service the attendee may have to click the play button in or unmute button to hear the sound.

### Force Logoff

Many times at the end of the live stream service you want the attendees to be logged out of the platform.  Simply click the **FORCE LOGOFF** button and any attendee that is currently logged into that event will be force to log out.

This is helpful if you are charge per CDN video delivery cost and want everyone off the CDN.

The blue tab bar allows you to click and work with the data for each of the different moderation items.  If you are the sole moderator for this event, you can easily move between the different tabs and moderate that section.  The following options are availble for moderations:
