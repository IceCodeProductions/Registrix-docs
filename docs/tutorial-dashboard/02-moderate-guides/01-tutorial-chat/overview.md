# Yatter Chat Overview

These directions will assist in the development of your event polls.  The concept of the event polls is to gain feedback from both the inperson and online audience at the same time.

## Operational Design

The polling is designed that the poll will not appear on the attendees screen until the Moderator sends the poll out. There is no way that any attendee can go through all the poll polls at their own pace. A moderator must send the poll out.  If the attendee is not online when the Moderator sends out the poll. The poll will be made available to the attendee when the log in only IF the poll is still active.  Once the moderator unstages the poll, no attendee will be able to provide their result. 

This means that an attendee cannot answer any of the prior polls if they arrived late.

## Types of Polling polls

The following types of Polls are available:

**Multiple Choice** - A selection of up to 5 different answers are available. An attendee can choose only 1 answer.

**Quiz** - A selection of up to 5 different answers are available. An attendee can choose only 1 answer. One answer is labeled as correct.

**Survey** - A selection of up to 5 different answers are available. An attendee can choose as many of the answers provided.
