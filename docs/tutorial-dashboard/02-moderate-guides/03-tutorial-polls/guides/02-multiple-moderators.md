The Poll Moderator service was designed to allow a team of moderators to work the service and everyone on the team will see the updated messages.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Dashboard**, then click **Moderator Event Poll**.  Now select the event to moderate.

## Procedures

To the left side of the screen is a listing of Poll items that can be displayed onto the attendee. The poll items do not appear on the attendee screens until the moderator Opens the poll.  If an attendee is not online when the poll is opened, that attendee will not be able to answer the poll.

### Staging

On the right side of the screen is the poll item that has been staged.  There is only one item allowed on stage. Once a poll item is on the stage you can then Open the poll by clicking on the **Open Poll** button.  This will instruct all the attendees to now show the poll item.  At this time results will start coming back into the stage screen. The poll will be visible on the attendees browser until you click the **Close Poll** button.  Once the poll is completed, the poll if it was one the attendee browser and they didn't answer, the poll item will be removed.  

### Results
