# Multiple QA Moderators

The QA Moderator service was designed to allow a team of moderators to work the service and everyone on the team will see the updated messages.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Dashboard**, then click **Moderator Event QA**.  Now select the event to moderate.

## Procedures

Any changes to any of the questions will be displayed to all the other QA moderators.

To the left side of the screen is a listing of submitted questions that has been created by the attendees.  Any submitted question will not be seen by any of the attendees.  

The Approved listing are any questions that attendees are able to see.  UnApproving any question will remove that question item from all attendee screens.

Questions can be edited by the moderator.

### Moderator Questions

The moderator can create questions.  Click on the **Create Question** button. Enter up to 500 characters and then click the Update button.  The question will now appear in the submitted box.

### Thumbs Up (Upvoting)

The Thumbs icon number will increase based on the number of attendees that has clicked the icon.

### Edit

### Approve

By clicking on the **Approve** link this question and its answer if created, will be displayed to all the attendees.  The attendees at that time can choose to upvote it.  The number of upvotes will appear in the Approved column.
