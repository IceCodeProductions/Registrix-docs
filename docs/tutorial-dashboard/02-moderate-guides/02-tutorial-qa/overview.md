# Questions & Answers Overview

These directions will assist in the development of your event Questions & Answers.  The concept of the event QA is to gain feedback from both the inperson and online audience at the same time. The Q & A service allows you to direct message back to just the attendee that asked the question. You can also provide an answer and return the question with the answer back to the entire audience.

The audience can then select to click on a Thumbs Up icon and upvote the question to be answered by the speaker.

## Operational Design

The Q&A service is designed to allow any attendee the ability to type in a question up to 500 characters and be able to Submit it to the moderator.  Submitted questions are not available to be seen by any other attendee.  The QA Moderator can read the question and they can type in one answer that is part of this record.  They can also send a message back just to that user, which is not attached to the record.

The QA Moderator can then **Approve** this question back to all the attendees.  The attendees can see that question and choose to upvote it by clicking on the thumbs up icon.  The thumbs up count is then displayed back to the QA moderator to get a general feedback from the audience about how important the question is.

The QA Moderator can also **UnApprove** any question which will remove the question from all the attendees.

Any Submitted question can be sent to the DSM Queue which will allow the DSM Moderator to show the question to the speaker

## Limitations

The Hide link will cause the question to be hidden from all the moderators. Once an Question is hidden you cannot unhide it.  The hidden question is available in the downloads for the event.

You can only provide one answer per question.  You can edit your answer while a question is in the submitted status.

The response is only available to the attendee during the current login and current event.
