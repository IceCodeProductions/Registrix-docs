## Overview of the Attendees

Attendees are the people that log into your Attendee app. The data collected by their login is found in the **Attendees** menu selection area.

A participant is a person that might log into the Attendee app.  When a participant logs into the Attendee App they are then considered an Attendee.

In this section of the Registrix, you can setup the **[Capture Attendee Data](/tutorial-attendees/attendee-capture)** to define what data to collect when your instance is setup for Lead Generation.

Also in lead generation you have the ability to setup a **[Block Domain List](/tutorial-attendees/attendee-block)** to prevent certain email accounts from registring.

The **[Download CSV](/tutorial-attendees/attendee-download)** allows you to download the captured data into a CSV format.  Which then can be used in Business Intellegience applications to help you understand the behaviors of your attendees.
