## Overview

Any email @domain name that is on this list will be denied the ability to log into the Attendee app.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Attendees**, then click **Block Domain List**.

## Procedure

You can create a seperate text file that has a comma delimited list of domains to deny into the Attendee App or you can manually enter the information into the Command Delimited List text box.

Every entry must start with a @ character.  You must have the (.) and extension so that the complete entry would be @domain.com  If you have a second domain place a comma after the last item and then enter that domain.  The last entry should not contain a , (comma).

>@domain.com,@domain.co,@domain.us

In order for the list to take effect on the Attendee app be sure to **Enable** the List Active.  When this List Active is disabled, the block list is ignored.

When finished be sure to click on the **Update** button.
