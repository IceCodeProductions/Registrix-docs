# Overview of Participants

Every Attendee into Registrix will become a Participant. A participant record is index on Email address or UserId. No duplicates are permitted with any email address or userid.

Information about the participant includes Salutation, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Pronoun and Suffix. If an Attendee is asked for these fields while logging into the system and the data field is blank, it will be replaced with the information that the attendee has entered.

Participants can have multiple address, company/organizations, phone numbers in the system. Only one of them can be preferred. The preferred information is what is used to transfer into any CRM application. If during login any of this information is requested to be entered by the attendee and the information is blank, the new data that the attendee enters will become the preferred.

Scoring is found on the Profile tab. This information can be transferred over to your CRM platform. The scoring of each participant indicates during the event helps indicate how active the attendee was, which can be used in remarketing purposes.  The formula is properitiery and has been crafted with over 10 years of live event knowledge.

If the Participant Active field is turned off, this account cannot log into your Registrix platform for any event.
