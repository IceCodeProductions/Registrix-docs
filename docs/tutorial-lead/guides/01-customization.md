## Explaination of Settings

This step only needs to occur once or when you decide to change the operational mode of Registrix.

There are a couple of decisions to be made that will impact how the Attendee app performs.

If you want to use ONE set of Lead Generation questions then be sure to set the Attendee Login Method to **Per Site**.

If you want to use different questions for each event, then set the Attendee Login Method to **Per Event**.

Within the collection of lead generation data there are two modes:

Lead Generation - Provides a list of questions.  An Attendee must answer them everytime they come back to the site.

Enrollment - An Attendee will enter their email, if they have already answered the questions, then they are logged in.  Otherwise they will be presented with the list of questions to answer.

:::tip Enrollment Features

Within Enrollment there are two additional operations that can be set.

> Skip Participant Data Collection - This will allow you to enter an email address and the system will NOT present the Lead Generation questions.  This is useful for when you are using an existing CRM package and have already have the questions answered.
>
> Participants Only Data Collection - This will only allow those to log in and answers the qeustions if there email address has already been entered into the participant list.  This is usefull for when you have targeted a group of people and you only want them to log into the system.
