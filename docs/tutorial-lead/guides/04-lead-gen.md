The Enable switch when purple will display the field to the Attendee.

The Required switch when purple will set the field to be required by the Attendee.

The drop down for Country/State/City can be used.  We wished we had every small city in the world listed, but there isn't a database that has this.  If you have many attendees coming from small cities, then we recommend that you set this to Open Text Fields and allow the Attendee to enter that data or allow their browser to populate the data.

The fields that has a **Finger** icon before it willl allow a radio button to exist.  Which means an attendee can only select one item.  We recommend no more than 6 answers

Enter the question and then (space) then use the # character to start with each question. 

> Are you having fun ?  #Yes #No #Perhaps #Munchies

The fields that have a **Thumbs Up** icon require 2 answers and the Attendee must choose one or the other.

Enter the question and then (space) then use the # character to start with each question. 

> Which animal is the better pet?  #Dog #Cat

The fields with a **Check box** icon allows the Attendee to check a box and select one or several answers.

Enter the question and then (space) then use the # character to start with each question.
