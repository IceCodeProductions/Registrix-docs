# Best Practices when using a Ticketing Platform

Be sure to use the same time zone when setting up events in the external platform and Registrix.  Failure to match the correct date/time between the patforms will results in the attendees not being able to see the event occuring in Registrix.

Registrx Group names and Ticket names must 100% match including capitization.

You can add additional events in Registrix to display video on demand or other live events.  Only the main event needs to have the third party event id entered into Registrix.

We strongly recommend that Registrix remains in Per-Site mode and to use only one Ticketing platform.

The Per-Event mode works when more than one ticketing service will be used.  Please consult with your account manager in order to help setup all the data points and testing.
