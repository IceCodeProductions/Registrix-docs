## Overview

The **Permissions** section allows you to set restrictions that relate to the event.  Not every permission listed here will be available in your instance.

### Allowed Groups

This drop down is available while running in any participant mode.  This drop down allows you to set any or all groups that can see the event.  If no groups are choosen, then no attendee will be able to see the event.

### Geo Location Rules

If you had created Geo Location rules, you can select which rule to enforce on the event.  The Attendee if they are part of the rule will not be able to see the event in their Event Selection menu.

### Expiration Hours

This option is available when the Event Expiration Mode is enabled.  Set the drop down to 0 if you do not want this event to expire.  Otherwise enter the amount of hours that you want this event to be available for viewing in the Attendee App  after the attendee starts to watch the event.

### Enable InPerson Interactivity

By enabling the in-person interactivity it is intended to allow the in-person audience at the event to be able to interact with the online audience at the same time.  All of the features found in the interactive tab will be available to these logins.  The actual video stream is not available for them to view, including any VOD.

By switching on the Require First Name, Last Name the in-person audience member must enter these values.

The security of the in-person interactivity is not the same as the normal type of logins.  Any person with the ShowID will be able to log into this service.
