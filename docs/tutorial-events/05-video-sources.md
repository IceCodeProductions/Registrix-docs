## Overview

The **Video Sources** section is where you will put in the information about the content to show in the video player area.

When attendees appear on the watch page prior to the event, you are able to show the attendee an image file instead of the video player which is called a **Cue Card**.  This image file should be a jpg with a dimension of 1280x720.  Click on the **Add** button to upload a new cue card, or select from the list box others that have been previously uploaded.

To enable the **Cue Card** enable the switch.

When the event is over the **Post Card** can be shown by enabling the switch.  The post card uses the same dimensions as the cue card.

Only one of the switches can be enabled at a time.

## Stream

This is where you setup the video player or streaming information.  To enable the **Stream** be sure to enable the switch.  Once enabled, the attendee app will use the stream information.

### Primary Stream

Make a selection using the **Video Source** of that service that you are using.  If your service is not on the list, use the Embed option.  You can then copy and paste the Stream Service Embed code into the text field.  Be sure to set the **Video Source Options** based on the embed type.  

>If the embed starts with a "div" be sure to select Div in the Video Source Options.  
>If the embed starts with "script" be sure to select the Script in the Video Source Options.
>If the embed starts with an "iframe" be sure to select the Iframe in the Video Source Options.


### Backup Stream

The concept of backup stream to the Registrix platform is to use a complete different live stream vendor.  For example, the primary stream could be done with Vendor A that has both a primary stream and backup stream.  Then use another live stream provider Vendor B for a backup streaming source.  This way in some extremely rare case, if Vendor A has issues, then the Attendees can switch to Vendor B, which is the backup source.

To enable the backup stream, enable the **Backup Stream** switch.  Follow the same instructions as in the Primary stream and complete the fields.

### Stream in Tab Area

When enabling the **Stream in Tab Area** this will move the video player into the Description area of the Attendee app and allow the video player area to be use for another service as an Embeded code.

This is normally used for gameification type events.  When enabled, the **Main Embed** field opens allowing you to paste in an embed code.  You can test the code by clicking on the **Validate Code** button.
