### Main Check Box

The **Main** checkbox will set the default event to the Attendee.  Without a main the attendee will be display a menu list of events to select to watch.  In order for the attendee to be directed to an event at login, check the box Main on one of the events.  Then click the **Update** button.

### Show Switch

The **Show** switch when set to On will allow the attendee to see this event in their other event selection window.  If this event is not ON, then the attendee will not see this event.  If you set the event check box Main and do not enable the show switch.  The attendee will be able to log into the system, default to the main event, and if they click on the other Event Selection,  they will not see this event.

### Categories

Every event is assigned to a category.   You can have unlimited categories.  You can order the list of how to appear based within the categories by clicking on the **Up/Down** arrow icon and moving the event into the position you want it to appear.

### Search bar

You can search for an event within the category by typing in title information or start date and times.

### Editing

You can edit the event by clicking on the **Gear** icon located into the action column.

When editing any event, on the bottom of the page is a "Default Tab to Display".  This drop down allows you to set which interactive tab that you want to be the main tab to be displayed to the attendee.  

There is also a "Force Refresh" check box.  When you check this item and then click on the **Update** button, any attendee that is currently on that event, their browser will refresh and any updated data will then be displayed.


### Delete

In order to delete the event click on the **Trash Can** icon in the action column.
