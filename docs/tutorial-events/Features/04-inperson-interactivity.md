title: In Person Interactivity Service

## Overview

The In-Person Interactivity is designed for the audience that is where the speaker is located. These are not people that are in an online mode watching the event. This service allows the audience to use their mobile phones or tablets that have an internet connection to be able to interact with the event.  There is no app to download or install.

All of the Tabs except for the schedule of events is availble to these attendees. Including the Huddle Room networking service.

## Access

Once the event has the **Enable Inperson Interactivity** found in the Permissions tab there is now a show id that has been assigned to the event.  To get this show id click on **Events / Manage**  To the right side in the Action column is a Receipt Icon.  Click on the Receipt Icon.  A new window will appear that will display the Show Id that must be used to access this event.

The audience members can access the service on the mobile phones by using a browser and then entering the URL.  The audience member will need to enter the Show Id so this number will need to be displayed. The assigned URL is found in the window that you just opened.

Another way the audience members can access the service is by using a QR code.  At the meeting you can have this QR code on a projector display or printed on paper.  You can use the URL from the QR code which will allow the audience direct access to enter their email address and/or name depending on what the admin setup.

The last method is having a mobile Application that is related to the show.  Many of these applications have a way to embed a service.  Use the Embed URL and populate this iframe/div and the audience member will then need to enter the show id.

## Security Awareness

The InPerson logs do not follow the normal Registrix log in modes. The security is based on the fact that a person is Live and In Person at the event where the Show ID or the QR code exists. Without the Show ID a person simply cannot gain access to this part of the application. Attendees will be downloaded with the status of "InPerson".
