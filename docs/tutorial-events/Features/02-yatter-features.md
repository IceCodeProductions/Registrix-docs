## Overview

Yatter is a highly scalable simple chat service that is event related. Yatter allows attendees to send Emoji's and GIF's using the Giphy library. Registrix is not in control of the selection or the content of the GIF's that are used by the attendee.


# Limitations

There are no chat rooms, no direct/private messaging between attendees, no break-out chat rooms.

# Downloading

The moderator is able to down all the chat messages using Registrix.  This is found in **[Attendees / Download CSV](/tutorial-attendees/attendee-download)**.


## Shadow Banning - Silence

If an attendee is being abusive, a moderator can **Silence** them. The attendee will not be made aware that they have been banned. Once an attendee is Silenced they cannot be unsilenced.  This helps to prevent the attendee from relogging back in under another account

## Queue DSM

Any chat message may be sent to the DSM Queue to be displayed to the speaker.


## Firewall Rules

Yatter is using Websockets port #443 with server names of socket-na1.registrix.io or socket-na2.registrix.io
