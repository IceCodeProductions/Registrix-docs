## Overview

The Huddle Room service is a WEBRTC application that allows the audience to join together into rooms and have a discussion that isn't centered around a speaker. Huddle Rooms are used by the audience to talk amoung themselves in a way that watch parties evolved at home.  This is a way to bring people together that are interested in meeting other people but have a distance between them. Such as the Las Vegas convention center.

## Functionality

The Huddle Room service is designed to be simple to use to the attendees. There is a hang up button, select microphone, select webcam buttons.

You can allow the attendees to create their own rooms and set the maximum number of attendees per room.  Rooms can be 8, 10, 14, 20 & 24 persons per room.  They are designed to be small and personal. There can be an unlimited number of rooms created.

As the admin you can decide if you will build all the rooms & optionally assign lock values. Attendees cannot enter a room without the lock value. To create rooms in advance, go to the Dashboard / Live Events Control Panel / select the event / Click on the Huddle tab.
