## Overview

The **Interactive Tabs** section allows you to configure the tabs that are located to the right side of the video player in the attendee application.  If In-Person is enabled, the tabs take over the full page of the mobile devices browser.

To enable a tab, slide the switch to the right side and the switch will turn purple.

The **Enable Info/Description of Events** tab displays a collection of data about the event as well as the digital library of files for the attendee to download.  All sponsor logos are placed on this tab.

Many vendors enable this tab prior to the event date so attendees can add it to their calendar. On the Show day this tab is then disabled and attendees can go directly any other tab.

The **Enable Agenda of Events** This tab will show all other events that have been created that the attendee is permitted to view.

The **Enable Question and Answers** This tab allows the inperson or online attendees to submit questions to the speaker. Attendees can view approved questions and up vote them instead of asking the same question.  This allows the Q&A Moderator to respond to questions that are all the same as well as submit it to the speaker to answer on behalf of.

**Enable Chat** allows you to use the built in Yatter Chat service or other third party chat services.

The **Enable Embed** area allows you to paste iframes of third party sites, such as Twitter, Instagram and others.  You should validate the paste by clicking on the **Validate Code** button. Select an **Embed Code Icon** to use when enabling this tab.  This icon will appear in the header of the interactive tab area.

**Enable Audience Reactions** is a way to allow the audience to click 4 different emotional states that allows them to express how they feel about the speaker content.  This toolset attempts to help keep the inperson as well as the online audience engaged with the speaker.

The **Enable Store** tab is designed to work with the Shopify store service.  Attendees will then be displayed a listing of products that they can purchase during the event, while staying in the Registrix application.
