### Stream in Tab Area

When enabling the **Stream in Tab Area** this will move the video player into the Description area of the Attendee app and allow the video player area to be use for another service as an Embeded code.

This is normally used for gameification type events.  When enabled, the **Main Embed** field opens allowing you to paste in an embed code.  You can test the code by clicking on the **Validate Code** button.
