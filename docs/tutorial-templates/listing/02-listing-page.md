## Overview


The event listing page is only created when a site is in **[Per Event](/faqs/terminology/persiteperevent#per-event-mode)** mode.  This special configuration allows you to have the ability to have different login pages per each event.  

When the attendee enters the main url in the browser they will be presented a listing of events that they can choose to register, login or watch.

## Consideration

The event listing area will list all the events that are set to **Show** in order of earliest date to longest date.


## Specs & Dimensions

The top header image is a width of 800px by 418px.  The max image size is 5Mb.

The logo max-height is set to 50px and can be any width less than 800px.

The color of the sides is selectable within the Registrix color picker tool.
