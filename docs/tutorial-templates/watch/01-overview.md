## How Templates work

Templates allow you to create different styles of how the watch page are displayed to the attendees.  You are able to clone an existing template, and then make the modification as well as create an entirely new templates.

Events are attached to a watched template.  You can setup different templates for each type of event, if you require this functionality, or you can just assign all the events to one template.  If you modify that one template, all the events connected to this template would be changed.

The watch page is designed to be a scroll-less page until the browser reaches a minimum setting.  The interactive tab areas allow for scrolling.
