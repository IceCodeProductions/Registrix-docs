## How All Templates work

Templates allow you to create different styles of how the login pages, watch page, emails are displayed to the attendees.  You are able to clone an existing template as a time saver and make changes to the newly create template.

You can edit any template and when save all features that uses that template is immediately updated.

All templates will work on all devices without you needing to make changes per device.


## Login Templates

**[Login Templates](login/overview)** are the first page that any attendee will see when accessing the attendee app.

## Watch Page Templates

The **[Watch Templates](login/overview)** are the second page that attendees will see after they log into the attendee app.

Events are attached to a watched template.  You can setup different templates for each type of event, if you require this functionality, or you can just assign all the events to one template.  If you modify that one template, all the events connected to this template would be changed.

## Email Templates
