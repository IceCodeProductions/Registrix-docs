## Overview

Banners are used for events when your use case is allowing jpg images to appear on the attendee screen throughout the presentation.  Banners can be setup to be clickable, and Registrix will track that attendee that clicked on it, the date time and how many times the banner was clicked.

Banners are served up by the Registrix platform and therefore should not be blocked by any ad blocker.

You can create a group of banners, assign their destination.  Banners are attached to the event.  Every event can have different banners while using the same watch page template.

There are two sizes that are supported - Billboard: 970x250px and Leaderboard: 970x90px

## Consideration

:::danger Take care

All banners must be the same size in the group.  Otherwise the banner will shift the page length during display.
