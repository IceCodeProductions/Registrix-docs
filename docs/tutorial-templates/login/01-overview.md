## How Templates work

Templates allow you to create different styles of how the login pages and watch page are displayed to the attendees.  You are able to clone an existing template, and then make the modification as well as create an entirely new templates.

If the site is setup as **[Per Event](/faqs/terminology/persiteperevent#per-event-mode)** mode then the login page that will be displayed is based on the event.

## Considerations

There is only one Login template that can be active when running in **[Per Site](/faqs/terminology/persiteperevent#per-site-mode)**. You can setup the new template in advanced and then on the required date, you can make this new template active.

When running in **[Per Event](/faqs/terminology/persiteperevent#per-event-mode)** mode then you have an additional option of creating a Listing page.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on the **Templates**, then click **Login**.
