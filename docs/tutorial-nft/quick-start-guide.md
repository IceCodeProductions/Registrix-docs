# Quick Start Guide

These directions will be the minimum that you need to setup to get your event live.

## New Installation

Following the steps below or in the Guides folder to get your Registrix instance up and running.

1.) Put the site into one of the **[NFT](guides/customization)** modes.

2.) Setup the **[Fonts](guides/brand-font)** and **[Icons](guides/brand-font#icons-menu-location)** you want to display.

3.) Configure the **[Attendee](guides/attendee-option)** options.

4.) Set the **[Groups](guides/groups)** that will be assigned to the wallets.

5.) Apply the **[Smart Contract](guides/contracts)** to each group.

6.) Complete the **[Templates for Login](/tutorial-templates/participant/design)** and the **[Templates for Watch](/tutorial-templates/watch/design)** .

7.) Start **[Managing Events](/tutorial-events/overview)**.

## Maintenance

Most maintenance is performed in the **[Managing Events](/tutorial-events/overview)**.

The other area of maintenance is **[Smart Contract](guides/contracts)**.  This is where you will define the smart contract with each group.  You need to update the token list if you are using a lazy sell method.  This means that the token isn't generated until after the sale has completed.  You must update the group with the latest token data from the smart contract.
