# NFTs and Smart Contract

You need to import the NFTs into Registrix by using the Smart Contract ID number.  To get this information, check with your market place.  

If you are selling the token when a sale occurs, then you must update this group with the updated NFTs by following the procedure below.  If all the NFTs have been minited then you need to run the procedure just once.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Participants**, then click **Groups**.

## Procedures

Click on the **Ticket** icon located to the left side of the group name.  This will open up a window.

In order to gather the NFTs that have been issued on the blockchain, click on the **Contract Import** button.

Enter the **Contract ID** and select the Marketplace in the drop down.  Then click on the **Search** button.

You will then see validation information about the contract.  If this information is correct, then click on the **Inport Tokens**.

>This process may take up to 5 minutes to complete.  This is all based on the number of NFT's that have been issued.

Once completed, you will see the number of tokens imported.  Click on the **Close** button.
