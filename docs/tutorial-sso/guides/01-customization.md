# Customization Settings

This step only needs to occur once or when you decide to change the operational mode of Registrix.


## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Customization**, then click **Settings**.

## Procedure

### SSO Only

Select the **Standard** SSO mode.  When this is enabled any browser that lands on the Attendee app will be validated that the browser is logged into the SSO service.  If the browser is not logged in, then the browser will redirect back to the SSO provider for a login request.

Select the **Enhanced** SSO mode and this will allow authenticated attendees access to videos based on groups. If no groups are found in the data-transmission, then attendees will be placed in the default group.

### SSO & Participant List

Select the **Enhanced with Participant List** allows authenticated attendees access to videos based on groups and allow Participants access to the system.

Then click the **Update** button.
