# Attendee Options

Skip if running in SSO only mode.

This step only needs to occur once or when you decide to change the operational mode of Registrix.



## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Customization**, then click **Attendee Options**.

## Procedure

If the SSO system is providing the email address of each client into the Registrix platform then check the box **Use as Email**.  If no email will be present then uncheck this box so that the email email function is disabled.  Participant can still use the email address as their userid.

Set all the other values of the site as per the instructions on the Vive page.

When finished be sure to click on the **Update** button.
