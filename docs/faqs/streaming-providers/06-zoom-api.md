## Setting up API with Zoom

his guide how to setup the Registrix Service in order to communicate to the Zoom Platform to create and run webinars within Registrix.

The Zoom Webinar platform is the industry leader in webinars. There are limitations depending on which zoom service you are subscribed to as to the amount of viewers permitted.

There are two services that needs to be setup to complete the entire project. There is the API connection and the webhook connection.

The API will allow you to sync the Registrix events directly into Zoom without having to load the Zoom platform. The webhooks will push changes of the Zoom platform into the Registrix platform.

You can choose to run the Web SDK or the Zoom client for your viewers. The web SDK has limitations on its functionality and is being currently being updated as of this writing.


## Getting Started

To setup the API Sync, open up your browser and go to marketplace.zoom.us and in another tab load up Registrix Vive.

To get started, In the Registrix Application, select customization, then Vendor Access Keys. This section of the application is used to store Application IDâ€™s and Secrets from external providers. To get started Click on the Add Button and select Zoom JWT. If you cannot install JWT due to your Zoom access, you can select Zoom OAuth from the drop down menu. Our preference is that you use Zoom JWT.
