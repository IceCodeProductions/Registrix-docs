## Nothing is being displayed after a viewer logs into the Attendee App

I want the system to display a listing of all the events that are available. In the events, all of the events are set to show, None of them are set to Main, but no thumbnails are appearing in the slide out.  When I set an event to Main, that event will show.

**Fix:**
Confirm that the switches are enabled in the Customization, Attendee Options, either Display Live or Display VOD.  If both of these two switches off, then no thumbnails of any events will be displayed and the slide out menu will not appear.

**Fix:**
Confirm that the attendee is part of any of the groups that the event is assigned.  Confirm that the attendee is not part of any of the Geo-location restrictions. To Disable Geo-Location for the event, Click on Events, then manage.  Select the event, open the "Permissions" accordian and set the Geo Location Rules to "No Geo Rules".
