# Overview

These directions will assist in the development of your event Questions & Answers.  The concept of the event QA is to gain feedback from both the inperson and online audience at the same time. The Q & A service allows you to direct message back to just the attendee that asked the question. You can also provide an answer and return the question with the answer back to the entire audience.

The audience can then select to click on a Thumbs Up icon and upvote the question to be answered by the speaker.
