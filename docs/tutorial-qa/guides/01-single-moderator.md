## Procedures

To the left side of the screen is a listing of Poll items that can be displayed onto the attendee. The poll items do not appear on the attendee screens until the moderator Opens the poll.  If an attendee is not online when the poll is opened, that attendee will not be able to answer the poll.

Once a poll item is on the stage you can then Open the poll by clicking on the **Open Poll** button.  This will instruct all the attendees to now show the poll item.  At this time results will start coming back into the stage screen. The poll will be visible on the attendees browser until you click the **Close Poll** button.
