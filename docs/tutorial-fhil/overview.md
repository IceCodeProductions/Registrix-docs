# Quick Start Guide

These directions will be the minimum that you need to setup to get your Down Stage Monitor Service functioning for your live event.

## What is a DSM service

A Down Stage Monitor or (DSM) is a visual method of communicating to your the speaker on stage without using an ear piece. The DSM can display messages from a V1/V2 or DSM operator. The speaker
will be able to see these messages on a screen.

At major AV conferences monitors are placed on the floor in front of the stage that is then connected to a laptop computer that is at the Video Village or Tech Table. The laptop computer is normally 1920x1080 and is set to duplicate the display so that the display on the external monitor matches the laptop.  The laptop computer requires an internet connection and browser.  The laptop computer browser will go to the URL that is specified in Registrix.  The V1/V2 operator if needed can then scroll the display down if the text on the screen is too long for the page.

If an external monitor is not available, then any mobile phone, tablet or laptop computer can be used. The device must have internet connection. You can text or email the URL to the device to open the URL to be displayed.

Due to power mode settings on devices it is recommend that you disable the screen sleep or low power mode while the DSM service is in use.

You can have multiple devices all accessing the DSM service at the same time without any issues.

## Security Considerations

Anyone with the URL link will be able to access the data. Due to the complexity of the URL link it is not expected that random services will be able to access the information. If security
of the information being relyed to the speaker is a concern, do not use this service. This is a display only service.

## DSM Moderators

The DSM moderator is a role that will published (or show) any of the queued messages.

Queued Messages are generated all within the Registrix system and they include manually typed messages, audience chat messages, audience polling data, audience question and answers, as well as audience reactions.

The DSM service was designed to either be run by a single person or team mode operating from anywhere with an internet connection. In team mode everyone can see what other team members are queuing and publishing.

## Enable the DSM Service

There is nothing to setup to enable the service.

## Adding Messages into the Queue

In all moderator panels in the Dashboard there is a option called **Queue DSM**.  Simply click this link once and the message will be sent into the queue.  If the DSM Moderator hides the message and you want to reshow it, simply repeat the Queue DSM link.

## Audience Reactions

If you are running the audience reactions service, the DSM monitor will not display the reactions while any message is on screen. To return back to the audience reactions, simply remove the On Screen message.

Anytime there is an on screen message, the audience reaction icons will not appear on the screen.


## Getting the DSM URL

There are two ways of getting the DSM URL:

1.) Click on **Dashboard**, then **Live Events Control Panel**. Click on the Event. Select the DSM Tab in the lower panel. Now copy the DSM URL.

2.) Click on **Dashboard**, then **DSM Controller**. Click on the Event. Now copy the DSM URL in the lower panel.
