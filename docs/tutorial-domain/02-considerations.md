# Considerations about Domain mode

The Domain mode setting is available for the clients that are running the approved participants.  This is a special operational mode for running events when you don't know the actual email addresses of the participants that need to access the live stream/videos.

If you are switching between Participant list and then Domain mode, it is best to clear the participant and attendee data found in the Datamanager.

If you manually add a participant manually, you will see the status of this account as "data entry".  This means to the system you are allowing this account access to Registrix using the email and access code regardless if their email matches what was configured in the domain settings.

We do not recommend allowing general public use email services like @gmail, @hotmail, @aol.com as anyone with an account can then log into the attendee system.

:::tip Use Case:

You have a client that needs to watch your event and they gave you something@gmail.com  You shouldn't allow @gmail.com access to the domain setting, so you create this account manually.  Using the built in email service, allow Registrix to send out a Participant Welcome to Email, or you have to manually send out to them the email address to use and the participant access code.  This type of account will REQUIRE the use of the participant access code.
