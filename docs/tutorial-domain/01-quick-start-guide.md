# Quick Start Guide

These directions will be the minimum that you need to setup to get your event live.

## New Installation

Following the steps below or in the Guides folder to get your Registrix instance up and running.

1.) Put the site into the **[Domain](guides/domain-customization)** mode.

2.) Setup the  **[Fonts](guides/brand-font)** and **[Icons](guides/brand-font#icons-menu-location)** you want to display.

3.) Configure the **[Attendee](guides/attendee-option)** options.

4.) Create the different **[Templates](guides/setup-templates)** including email.

5.) Set the **[Groups](guides/groups)** that will be assigned to the incoming participants.

6.) Build the  **[Authorize Domains](guides/domains)** that will allow for participant logins.

7.) Complete the **[Templates for Participants](/tutorial-templates/participant/design)** and the **[Templates for Watch](/tutorial-templates/watch/design)** .

8.) Start **[Managing Events](/tutorial-events/overview)**.

## Maintenance

The only general maintenance that would need to be performed while in Domain mode is changing of the **[Authorize Domains](guides/domains)** if you are changing up to different companies or different audiences.

Most other maintenance is performed in the **[Managing Events](/tutorial-events/overview)**.

The other area of maintenance is **[Managing Participants](/tutorial-participants/managing-participants/overview)**.  This is where you can create/edit/disable information about the participants.
