# Authorize Domains

This step only needs to occur once or when you decide to change what participant domains are permitted into the system.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Participants**, then click **Authorize Domains**.

:::tip

If this menu option is unavailable, visit the **[customization settings](domain-customization)** to set the domain mode.

:::

## Procedure

You can create up to five different collection of authorized domains.  There is no limit to the number of @domains in each collection.

### Add

Click on the **Add** button located to the right side.  This will create a new domain collection.

### Edit

Click on the **Gear** icon located to the right side in the Action column.  This will allow editing to the existing domain collection.

### Disable

Click on the **Notepad** icon located to the right side in the Action column.

This will disable any participant from logging into the attendee system if they are in this domain collection.

## Authorize Domain Details

Select the **Group** from the drop down that this collection of domains that each participant will be saved under.

To the right side under the **Accepted Domains**, enter the domain names starting with the '@' character.  You must enter the full domain name such as @registrix.io then a ',' for the next domain name.  When finished do not leave a trailing ',' 

    @velikom.com,@registrix.io,@registrix.us

The **General Access Code** allows you to set a required code that must be entered by everyone coming in with this collection.  This creates a level of security that these participants must know prior to arriving on the site.  You can enable or disable at will.

### Secured Second Level Email Authorization

The **Secured Second Level Email Authorization** will require this collection of domains to be sent an email for entry.  Disabling this feature will allow the participant to enter using just their email or the email and General Access Code.

If this feature is enabled the Email Details and Display Message must be set.

### Email Details

The **Renew Access Code** if enabled will require a different access code every time that this participant attempts to log into the service. This code is NOT the same as the General Access Code. The system will autogenerate a new access code for the participant.

The **Embed Email in Link** will place the participants email in the link for them to click.  This reduces the data entry that the participant will need to perform.

The **Email Message to use** is the message that you want to send out to the participant when they attempt to sign in.

### Display Message

This message is an on screen display that will instruct the participant to check their email for a message.  Without this email message, the participant is unable to log into the system.  Normally you can just enter "Please check your email for your login credentials".
