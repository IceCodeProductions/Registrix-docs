## Edit

Select the template from the **Select Template** drop down and then click on the **Edit** button.

Enter a **Sender Name** (ie: "Production Manager")  This is the name that will be visible to the attendee's email system as the "from" name.

Enter a **Subject Line** in the text box, which will be in the attendees subject line of the email message.

Using the slider tool you can specify the width of the email message from 300px to 600px. You can leave this at 600px.

You can select a background color to use based on your companies requirements for the logo branding.

If your logo isn't in the list box, click on the **New** button and in the popup window, drag and drop a logo image file and then click on the **Upload** button.  The logo will now appear in the template box.  Click the **Close** button to the lower right side of the slider window.

Now click on the **Gear** of the Text section.  A new slider window will appear that will allow you to start entering text that you want to have written up to the attendee.

In your message you will need to add in shortcodes for the attendee to gain information about their account.  To do this click on the **Copy** icon in the shortcodes area and then in the Text editor, paste this shortcode into the box.
