# Attendee Options

This step only needs to occur once or when you decide to change the operational mode of Registrix.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Customization**, then click **Attendee Options**.

## Procedure

Make sure the check box **Use as Email** is checked.  If this is unchecked all email functions are disabled.

The option of **Attendee Analytics** must be enabled prior to any events in order for the heartbeat data to be collected. If you do NOT enable Attendee Analytics there will be no way to capture this data after the event has started. 


Set all the other values of the site as per the instructions on the Vive page.

When finished be sure to click on the **Update** button.
