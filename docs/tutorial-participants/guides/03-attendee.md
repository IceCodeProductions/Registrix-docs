# Attendee Options

This step only needs to occur once or when you decide to change the operational mode of Registrix.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Customization**, then click **Attendee Options**.

## Procedure

Make sure the check box **Use as Email** is checked.  If this is unchecked all email functions are disabled.

The **Display Cookie Message** when disable will not display the bottom banner on the login page that is related to how cookies will be used. We recommend that you create a message in either the lower part of the login page or in the Accept Terms.  For more advance concepts please reach out to your account manager.

Set all the other values of the site as per the instructions on the Vive page.

When finished be sure to click on the **Update** button.
