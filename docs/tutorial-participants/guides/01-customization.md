# Customization Settings

This step only needs to occur once or when you decide to change the operational mode of Registrix.

You will need to know if you are going to upload a list of account, create manually OR use a eTicketing solution such as Eventbrite or Universal and sell online tickets for this instance.

## Menu Location

From the left side menu, click on **Customization**, then click **Settings**.

## Procedure

### Control your own Participants

Select the **UserID Only** or the **UserID with Access Code**. 

Then click the **Update** button. 

Select either **Per Site** or **Per Event** as of how the Attendee Login Method will work.

The Registrix service is now in the Participant mode.

### Use Eventbrite or Universal

Select the **eTicket UserID Only** or the **eTicket UserID with Access Code**.

Then click the **Update** button. 

Select either **Per Site** or **Per Event** as of how the Attendee Login Method will work.

The Registrix service is now ready to accept attendee feeds from Eventbrite or Universe.
