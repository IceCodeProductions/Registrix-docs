# Connection of Universe


This guide will show to setup the Registrix Service in order to use the Universe Platform to sell tickets for an event, including setting up the webhooks, API Keys.

The Universe platform allows you to sell online tickets for events and be able to promote the selling of the tickets on the Universe Platform as well as getting Universe Widgets and be able to sell tickets on other websites.  Once everything is configured correctly, then every ticket sale that occurs, no matter from what site, the ticket purchaserâ€™s information will then be sent to the Registrix platform.  That purchaser would be able to log into Registrix about 30 seconds after the sale.

There are two services that needs to be setup to complete the entire project.  There is the WebHook service that must be setup and there is the API setup that must occur.

The API will allow you to sync all of the ticket sales from Universe and place the viewer data into Registrix as Approved List viewers.  This sync manly occurs only when you have sold tickets prior to activating the webhook or if the webhook goes offline.

You will also be able to add the Get a Ticket button on the Registrix Microsite service in case a viewer is shared a link to the Registrix service.

You must be one of the **[eTicketing Participant](../guides/customization#use-eventbrite-or-universal)** modes.

## Considerations

If you have multiple Registrix sites that you need connected to your Universe Account, please contact with your Registrix Account Manager so we can give you an updated URL and Secret to use for all of the sites.

In the event that the secret has been exposed click on the Reset button and a new code will be exposed. 

The Secret of Registrix MUST match the Secret code that is being pasted in Universe.

If you accidently clicked the reset button, when the event is live, then you must paste this new code to the Universe system.


## Setting up the Webhook

### Menu Location

### Procedure
