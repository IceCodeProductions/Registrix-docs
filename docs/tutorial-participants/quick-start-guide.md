1.) Put the site into one of the **[Participant](guides/customization)** modes.

2.) Setup the **[Fonts](guides/brand-font)** and **[Icons](guides/brand-font#icons-menu-location)** you want to display.

3.) Configure the **[Attendee](guides/attendee-option)** options.

4.) Set the **[Groups](guides/groups)** that will be assigned to the participants.

5.) If you had selected eTicketing modes, please see the folder API & Webhook and select your external ticket vender.

6.) Complete the **[Templates for Login](/tutorial-templates/login/overview)**  and the **[Templates for Watch](/tutorial-templates/watch/overview)**.

## Maintenance

Most maintenance is performed in the **[Managing Events](/tutorial-events/overview)**.

The other area of maintenance is **[Managing Participants](/tutorial-participants/managing-participants/overview)**.  This is where you can create/edit/disable information about the participants.  If the system is in eTicket mode, then some features are disabled.
