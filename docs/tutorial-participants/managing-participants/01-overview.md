# Management of Participants

All Participants must be associated with a at least one **[Group](/faqs/terminology/group)**. Participants accounts created here can access the Attendee app.  If an account is not created, this attendee will not be able to log into the Attendee app.

Registrix will not allow you to enter a duplicate UserID/Email.  This field requires a unique entry (this field is encrypted within the tables).

In order to work with any participant, you start at the Search Participants bar.  If you just click the **Search** button without any filters, Registrix will return up to 10,000 rows to review.
